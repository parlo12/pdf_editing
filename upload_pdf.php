// To use this code, other developers can simply add it to their project and then call the upload_pdf() function to upload a PDF document. Once the PDF document has been uploaded, they can then call the assign_dynamic_variables() function to assign dynamic variables to the PDF.

// To add more dynamic variables, developers can simply add new variables to the $variables array in the assign_dynamic_variables() function.

// To assign dynamic variables to different places in the PDF, developers can use the $pdf->SetVariable() function. For example, to assign the first_name variable to the header of the PDF, they would use the following code:

    $pdf->SetVariable('first_name', 'John Doe');
    $pdf->SetHeader('<h1>Hello, {first_name}!</h1>');
    
// To allow users to edit the fields that are in the PDF documents with the dynamic variables that are available to them, you can use the following code:

// Get the uploaded PDF document.
$pdf_path = upload_pdf();

// If the PDF document was uploaded successfully, open it for editing.
if ($pdf_path !== false) {
  // Open the PDF document for editing.
  $pdf = new TCPDF();
  $pdf->Open($pdf_path, true);

  // Get the fields in the PDF document.
  $fields = $pdf->GetFields();

  // Loop through the fields and allow the user to edit them.
  foreach ($fields as $key => $field) {
    // Get the dynamic variable for the field.
    $dynamic_variable = $variables[$key];

    // Set the value of the field to the dynamic variable.
    $pdf->SetFieldValue($key, $dynamic_variable);
  }

  // Output the PDF.
  $pdf->Output();
}

// This code will open the uploaded PDF document for editing and then loop through all of the fields in the document. For each field, the code will get the dynamic variable for the field and then set the value of the field to the dynamic variable.

// Once the code has looped through all of the fields, it will output the PDF document. This will allow the user to edit the fields in the PDF document with the dynamic variables that are available to them.

// To allow the user to edit the dynamic variables, you can use a form to collect the new values for the variables. Once the user has submitted the form, you can then use the $pdf->SetVariable() function to update the dynamic variables in the PDF document.
